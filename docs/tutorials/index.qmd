# Getting Started Tutorials

Learn Cloud Resource Simulator through hands-on, learning-oriented tutorials. These guides are designed to help you understand the core concepts and workflows through practical examples.

## Available Tutorials

### [Data Exploration](data-exploration.qmd)
Learn how to explore and analyze cloud resource utilization data using the simulator's data generation capabilities.

**What you'll learn:**
- Loading and exploring synthetic cloud data
- Understanding workload patterns
- Visualizing resource utilization
- Identifying inefficiencies

**Duration:** ~15 minutes

---

### [Workload Signatures](workload-signatures.qmd)
Understand the different workload archetypes and their characteristic resource usage patterns.

**What you'll learn:**
- 12+ workload types and their signatures
- CPU, memory, and network patterns
- Temporal autocorrelation
- Application-specific behaviors

**Duration:** ~20 minutes

---

### [Gaussian Process Modeling](gaussian-processes.qmd)
Build robust time series forecasting models using Gaussian Processes with GPyTorch.

**What you'll learn:**
- Sparse variational GP models
- Composite periodic kernels
- Training on operational data
- Prediction with uncertainty quantification

**Duration:** ~30 minutes
