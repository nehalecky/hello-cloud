## Learning Path

We recommend following the tutorials in this order:

1. **Data Exploration** → Understand synthetic data generation
2. **IOPS Web Server Analysis** → Real-world time series EDA
3. **Workload Signatures** → Learn workload archetypes
4. **Gaussian Process Modeling** → Build forecasting models

**Alternative paths:**
- **For forecasting focus**: Data Exploration → IOPS Analysis → GP Modeling
- **For cloud optimization**: Data Exploration → Workload Signatures
- **For anomaly detection**: IOPS Analysis → GP Modeling
