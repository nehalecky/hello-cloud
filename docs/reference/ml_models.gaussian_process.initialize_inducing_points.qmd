# ml_models.gaussian_process.initialize_inducing_points { #cloud_sim.ml_models.gaussian_process.initialize_inducing_points }

```python
ml_models.gaussian_process.initialize_inducing_points(
    X_train,
    num_inducing,
    method='evenly_spaced',
)
```

Initialize inducing point locations for sparse GP.

Args:
    X_train: Training inputs of shape (n, d)
    num_inducing: Number of inducing points (M)
    method: Initialization method:
        - "evenly_spaced": Evenly spaced across training range (default)
        - "random": Random subset of training points
        - "kmeans": K-means clustering (not yet implemented)

Returns:
    Inducing points tensor of shape (M, d)

Example:
    ```python
    inducing_points = initialize_inducing_points(
        X_train=X_train_norm,
        num_inducing=200,
        method="evenly_spaced"
    )
    ```
