# Cloud Resource Metrics Correlation Patterns: Empirical Research Report

## Executive Summary

This report synthesizes empirical research on correlation patterns between cloud resource metrics (CPU, memory, network, disk I/O) across different application types. Research shows strong temporal correlations (0.7-0.8) in resource usage patterns [1], with memory emerging as a critical bottleneck in co-located clusters [2]. Machine learning workloads demonstrate unique GPU-CPU-memory interdependencies [3], while microservices exhibit cross-VM correlations due to application dependencies [4].

## 1. Empirical Correlation Coefficients

### 1.1 Temporal Autocorrelation Patterns

Research on cloud workload patterns reveals **strong temporal correlation with ACF values of 0.7-0.8 for the first 10 lags** across all resource usage types [1]. This indicates that resource usage is predictable in the short-term (up to a few hours).

### 1.2 Memory Access Correlations

In SPEC CPU2017 workloads:
- **79% of applications show correlation in memory access patterns** (vs. only 27% in SPEC CPU2006) [5]
- All correlated workloads demonstrate **Hurst parameters > 0.5**, confirming self-similarity [5]
- Memory access intervals at small time scales (milliseconds) follow exponential distribution
- Aggregated processes at large scales (minutes) show self-similarity

### 1.3 Cross-Resource Dependencies

CPU utilization correlates with multiple system metrics [6]:
- Memory usage
- Disk I/O operations
- Network latency
- Job queue length

Including these correlated features improves predictive performance significantly compared to CPU-only models.

## 2. Application-Specific Correlation Patterns

### 2.1 Web Applications

Web applications demonstrate **three distinct daily and three weekly workload patterns** [7]:
- Time-series analysis captures temporal dependencies effectively
- Recurring patterns link to service quality metrics
- **CPU utilization ~20% correlates with high response-time performance** [8]

### 2.2 Database Workloads

Database systems show specific correlation patterns:
- **Daily peak usage 10-100x higher than mean usage** [1]
- Strong correlation between unsuccessful jobs and workload characteristics [9]
- Terminated tasks utilize significant cloud resources despite failure

### 2.3 Machine Learning Workloads

ML workloads demonstrate unique resource patterns [3]:

**Training Phase:**
- GPU performance **10x faster than equivalent-cost CPUs** [10]
- Memory bandwidth critical: CPUs offer ~50GB/s vs GPUs at 7.8TB/s [11]
- **High memory requirement (≥24GB HBM) for training** [12]

**Inference Phase:**
- Testing time: CPU ~5 seconds vs GPU ~2-3 seconds per image [13]
- Lower resource requirements but latency-sensitive
- CPUs viable for lightweight model inference

### 2.4 Microservices Architecture

Microservices exhibit **cross-VM workload correlations** [14]:
- Dependencies among applications create correlated patterns
- Groups of VMs frequently show synchronized workload behaviors
- Hidden Markov Models effectively characterize temporal correlations

Key metrics for microservice benchmarking [15]:
- Latency
- Throughput
- Scalability
- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Network usage

## 3. Time-Lagged Correlations

### 3.1 Cascade Effects

Research identifies important time-lagged relationships [16]:
- **CPU allocation spikes → Memory pressure (delayed response)**
- CPU bottlenecks cause queuing, leading to subsequent memory issues
- Network congestion correlates with later CPU spikes

### 3.2 Monitoring Latency Impact

Cloud monitoring systems experience inherent delays [17]:
- **Metric collection latency: 2-4 minutes** for some cloud providers
- This affects autoscaling responsiveness
- High-frequency monitoring needed to detect short-lived spikes

### 3.3 Predictive Modeling

LSTM and RNN models capture temporal dependencies [18]:
- Retain contextual information across time steps
- Model periodic behavior and usage spikes
- Predict evolving workload trends

## 4. Correlation Patterns by Operating State

### 4.1 Normal Operating State

During normal operations:
- **Service Workload Patterns (SWPs) remain relatively stable** [8]
- Fixed mapping between infrastructure input and QoS
- Predictable resource consumption patterns

### 4.2 Peak Load Conditions

Under peak load:
- **Memory becomes primary bottleneck** in co-located clusters [2]
- CPU and disk I/O show cyclical fluctuation
- Memory usage remains approximately constant while other resources spike

### 4.3 Failure Conditions

During failures [9]:
- Strong correlation between unsuccessful tasks and requested resources
- Failed jobs consume significant resources before termination
- Resource correlation patterns help predict job failures

## 5. Quantitative Correlation Matrices

### 5.1 Resource Utilization Correlations

Based on Alibaba cluster traces [2]:
- CPU and disk I/O show **daily cyclical correlation**
- Memory usage exhibits **weak correlation with CPU cycles**
- Network throughput correlates with CPU during batch processing

### 5.2 Performance-Resource Mapping

Established correlations [8]:
- Low CPU (~20%) → High response time performance
- Memory utilization > 80% → Performance degradation
- Network latency increases → CPU wait time increases

## 6. Published Datasets for Validation

### 6.1 Alibaba Cluster Traces

Multiple versions available [19]:
- **cluster-trace-v2017**: 1,300 machines, 12 hours, online+batch workloads
- **cluster-trace-v2018**: 4,000 machines, 8 days, includes DAG information
- **AMTrace**: Fine-granularity microarchitectural metrics

### 6.2 Google Cluster Traces

2019 dataset contains [20]:
- **2.4TiB of workload traces**
- 8 different clusters worldwide
- Detailed resource usage and job failure patterns

## 7. Key Findings and Implications

### 7.1 Strong Temporal Dependencies
- **0.7-0.8 autocorrelation** enables short-term prediction [1]
- Resource usage predictable up to several hours
- Critical for proactive resource management

### 7.2 Memory as Critical Bottleneck
- Memory consistently emerges as performance bottleneck [2]
- Unlike CPU/disk, memory usage remains constant during load spikes
- Memory-aware scheduling crucial for performance

### 7.3 Workload-Specific Patterns
- Different application types exhibit distinct correlation signatures [7]
- ML workloads require special consideration for GPU-CPU-memory balance [3]
- Microservices need cross-VM correlation analysis [14]

### 7.4 Monitoring Implications
- Sub-minute monitoring required to capture spikes [17]
- Multi-metric correlation essential for root cause analysis [16]
- Time-lagged effects must be considered in autoscaling [18]
