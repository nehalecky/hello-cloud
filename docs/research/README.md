# Research Foundation

This directory contains the empirical research that forms the foundation of our cloud resource simulation models.

## Key Research Documents

### 1. [Cloud Resource Patterns Research](../cloud-resource-patterns-research.md)
- Comprehensive analysis of real-world cloud utilization statistics
- Shocking findings: 13% CPU utilization, 30-32% waste
- Workload-specific patterns and inefficiencies
- Industry benchmarks and best practices

### 2. [Cloud Resource Correlations Report](../cloud-resource-correlations-report.md)
- Empirical correlation matrices between resource metrics
- Time-lagged correlations and dependencies
- Application-specific correlation patterns
- Statistical validation methods

## Key Findings Summary

### Utilization Statistics
- **CPU**: Average 13% utilization (industry-wide)
- **Memory**: Average 20% utilization
- **Waste**: 30-32% of cloud spending ($226B in 2024)
- **Dev Environments**: 70% waste (worst category)
- **Batch Processing**: 60% waste
- **GPU/ML Workloads**: 45% waste from idle periods

### Correlation Patterns
- **Strong temporal autocorrelation**: 0.7-0.8 for first 10 time lags
- **Memory patterns**: 79% of modern workloads show correlation
- **CPU-Memory**: Varies by workload (0.2-0.95 correlation)
- **Network-CPU**: High correlation in web apps (0.7-0.8)

### Temporal Patterns
- **Daily**: 40-60% increase during business hours
- **Weekly**: 60-80% drop on weekends
- **Seasonal**: 300-500% spikes for retail during holidays
- **Burst**: 10-100x spikes possible for viral events

## Application to Simulation

These research findings directly inform:
1. **Base utilization rates** in our models
2. **Correlation matrices** for multivariate generation
3. **Temporal patterns** (daily, weekly, seasonal)
4. **Waste factors** by application type
5. **Anomaly patterns** and failure modes
