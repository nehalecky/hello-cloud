# Technical Design Documents

This directory contains comprehensive technical design documents for major system components and data processing pipelines.

## Active Design Documents

_Currently empty - design documents will be added as needed for CloudZero production data integration and HuggingFace dataset workflows._

## Design Document Template

Technical Design Documents in this repository should follow this structure:

### Required Sections
1. **Executive Summary** - One-page overview with key decisions
2. **Problem Statement** - Quantified challenges and constraints
3. **Goals and Non-Goals** - Clear scope boundaries
4. **Technical Architecture** - System design with diagrams
5. **Implementation Design** - Detailed technical approach
6. **Infrastructure Requirements** - Resource and scaling needs
7. **Alternative Solutions** - Options considered and rejected
8. **Risk Analysis** - Technical and operational risks with mitigation
9. **Implementation Plan** - Timeline with milestones
10. **Success Metrics** - Quantifiable outcomes
11. **Cost-Benefit Analysis** - ROI calculation
12. **Decision** - Clear recommendation with rationale

### Optional Sections
- Security and Compliance
- Monitoring and Observability
- Future Enhancements
- Appendices (code samples, schemas, scripts)

### Document Metadata
Each TDD should include YAML frontmatter:
```yaml

## Design Principles

### 1. Evidence-Based Decisions
- All claims must be backed by data or research
- Include quantitative analysis where possible
- Cite sources for technical assertions

### 2. Realistic Constraint Analysis
- Acknowledge real-world limitations (hardware, time, expertise)
- Provide fallback options for resource constraints
- Consider operational complexity in recommendations

### 3. Community Impact Focus
- Consider how decisions affect broader research community
- Design for accessibility and reproducibility
- Document limitations clearly to prevent misuse

### 4. Cost-Conscious Architecture
- Include detailed cost analysis for all approaches
- Consider both one-time and ongoing operational costs
- Justify resource requirements with clear value propositions

## Review Process

### Design Review Stages

1. **Draft**: Initial design for internal review
2. **Review**: Stakeholder review and feedback incorporation
3. **Approved**: Final design approved for implementation
4. **Implemented**: Design has been successfully implemented

### Review Criteria
- [ ] Technical approach is feasible with available resources
- [ ] Risks are identified with appropriate mitigation strategies
- [ ] Cost-benefit analysis supports the recommendation
- [ ] Implementation plan is realistic and achievable
- [ ] Success metrics are measurable and appropriate

### Reviewers by Domain
- **Data Engineering**: Technical architecture, scalability, performance
- **Infrastructure**: Cloud resources, security, operational concerns
- **Research**: Community impact, accessibility, scientific value
- **Engineering Lead**: Overall feasibility, resource allocation, timeline

## Implementation Tracking

Track implementation progress by linking to:
- [ ] Implementation issues/tickets
- [ ] Code repositories
- [ ] Deployment documentation
- [ ] Post-implementation reviews

## Contributing

When creating new Technical Design Documents:

1. **Use the template structure** outlined above
2. **Include quantitative analysis** for all major decisions
3. **Consider alternative approaches** and document why they were rejected
4. **Plan for failure scenarios** with appropriate mitigation strategies
5. **Focus on reproducibility** and community enablement
6. **Update this index** when adding new documents
