# Cloud Resource Utilization Research Platform - Technical Documentation

## Overview

This technical documentation provides detailed information about the Cloud Resource Utilization Research Platform, a Bayesian modeling framework for understanding and simulating cloud workload patterns. This platform combines hierarchical probabilistic models, synthetic data generation, and time series forecasting to explore optimization opportunities in cloud infrastructure.

## Technical Foundation

This research platform addresses documented inefficiencies in cloud resource utilization through rigorous statistical modeling:

### Empirical Observations from Literature
- CPU utilization: 12-15% average across cloud infrastructure
- Memory utilization: 18-25% average
- Resource waste: 25-35% of total cloud spend
- Development environment efficiency: 25-35%
- Batch processing efficiency: 35-45%

These observations inform our probabilistic models and synthetic data generation parameters.

## Key Innovations

### 1. Probabilistic Resource Simulation
- Grounded in published research and industry reports
- 20+ application archetypes with distinct resource patterns
- Multivariate correlation modeling using PyMC
- Temporal patterns (daily, weekly, seasonal)

### 2. Foundation Model Integration
- Amazon Chronos for zero-shot time series forecasting
- TimesFM and TiReX models for advanced predictions
- Ensemble approaches for robust forecasting
- Uncertainty quantification in all predictions

### 3. Hierarchical Bayesian Framework with PyMC
- Three-level hierarchy: Industry → Application Archetype → Resource
- Prior distributions informed by empirical research
- Posterior sampling for uncertainty quantification
- Bayesian updating mechanisms for continuous learning
- Multivariate correlation structures between resource metrics

## Quick Start

### Installation with uv

```bash
# Install uv (modern Python package manager)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cloud-resource-simulator.git
cd cloud-resource-simulator

# Create environment and install
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync --all-extras  # Installs everything from pyproject.toml
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from cloud_sim.data_generation import WorkloadPatternGenerator, WorkloadType
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Generate realistic workload patterns
generator = WorkloadPatternGenerator()
df = generator.generate_time_series(
    workload_type=WorkloadType.WEB_APP,
    start_time=datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7),
    end_time=datetime.now(),
    interval_minutes=60
)

# Validate against research
print(f"Mean CPU Utilization: {df['cpu_utilization'].mean():.1f}%")  # ~15%
print(f"Mean Memory Utilization: {df['memory_utilization'].mean():.1f}%")  # ~35%
print(f"Resource Waste: {df['waste_percentage'].mean():.1f}%")  # ~35%
```

### Advanced Forecasting

```python
from cloud_sim.ml_models import CloudCostForecaster

# Initialize forecaster with ensemble
forecaster = CloudCostForecaster(ensemble=True)

# Generate cost forecast
results = forecaster.forecast_unit_economics(
    df=df,
    horizon=48,  # 48 hours ahead
    metrics=["hourly_cost", "cpu_utilization", "efficiency_score"]
)
```

## Research Foundation

This project synthesizes findings from:
- Academic research (35+ papers)
- Industry reports (Gartner, FinOps Foundation)
- Cloud provider documentation (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Real-world case studies (Netflix, Uber, Shopify)

Key findings that inform our models:
- **CPU utilization**: 13% average (shocking but documented)
- **Memory utilization**: 20% average
- **Waste percentage**: 30-32% across industries
- **Development environments**: 70% waste (worst category)
- **Batch processing**: 60% waste
- **ML/GPU workloads**: 45% waste from idle periods

## The Workload Genome Initiative

This research contributes to establishing a comprehensive taxonomy of cloud workload patterns, analogous to genomic mapping in biological sciences:

1. **Comprehensive taxonomy** of application patterns
2. **Standardized dataset** for benchmarking
3. **Open-source contribution** to accelerate innovation
4. **Industry collaboration** to refine patterns
