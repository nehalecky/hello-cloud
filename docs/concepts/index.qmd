# Conceptual Documentation

Understand the theory, research, and design decisions behind Cloud Resource Simulator.

## Research Foundation

Our simulator is built on extensive empirical research analyzing real-world cloud infrastructure patterns.

### [Cloud Resource Utilization Patterns](research/cloud-resource-patterns-research.qmd)
Comprehensive analysis of industry-wide cloud resource utilization statistics.

**Key findings:**
- 13% average CPU utilization across cloud infrastructure
- 30-32% waste in cloud spending
- Workload-specific inefficiency patterns
- 35+ research citations

---

### [Resource Correlation Analysis](research/cloud-resource-correlations-report.qmd)
Empirical correlation matrices between cloud resource metrics.

**Key findings:**
- Temporal autocorrelation: 0.7-0.8 for first 10 lags
- CPU-Memory correlations vary by workload (0.2-0.95)
- Network-CPU high correlation in web apps (0.7-0.8)

---

### [Time Series Anomaly Datasets](research/timeseries-anomaly-datasets-review.qmd)
Curated catalog of HuggingFace datasets for cloud anomaly detection.

**Top recommendations:**
- AutonLab/Timeseries-PILE
- Lemma-RCA-NEC/Cloud_Computing
- Energy domain datasets as cloud infrastructure analogs

---

### [Foundation Model Evaluation](research/opentslm-foundation-model-evaluation.qmd)
Assessment of Stanford's OpenTSLM for cloud time series forecasting.

**Key finding:** Not suitable for cloud anomaly detection (medical domain focus, no pre-trained weights)

---

## Design Documentation

### [Gaussian Process Architecture](design/gaussian-process-design.qmd)
Complete design specification for our GP-based forecasting system.

**Topics covered:**
- Sparse variational approximations
- Composite periodic kernels
- Student-t likelihood for robustness
- 92% test coverage implementation

---

## Framework Philosophy

The Cloud Resource Simulator implements a **multi-model approach**:

1. **Gaussian Processes**: Time series forecasting with uncertainty quantification
2. **Bayesian Hierarchical Models**: Industry→Application→Resource hierarchy
3. **Foundation Models**: Zero-shot forecasting (Chronos, TimesFM)

**Core principle:** Empirically-grounded simulation based on real-world research, not assumptions.
