## What Was Removed

### Diagnostic Artifacts (Cleaned Pre-Rebase)
- `diagnose_gp_results.py`
- `gp_diagnostics.txt`, `gp_diagnostics_plots.png`
- `subsampling_*.txt`, `subsampling_*.png`
- `docs/logging-strategy.md`
- `docs/modeling/gp-inducing-points-analysis.md`
- `docs/modeling/gp-initialization-fix.md`

### Abandoned Dataset Documentation
- `docs/research/alibaba-trace-analysis.md`
- Test references to alibaba_trace_analysis.md

### Concept Churn Commits (Squashed)
- **89 commits** of iteration, fixes, refinements squashed into 10 clean commits
- Preserved:
  - Final working state
  - Key milestone commits
  - Architectural decisions
- Eliminated:
  - "fix: typo" commits
  - "wip: experiment" commits
  - "chore: update" commits
  - Back-and-forth on implementation details

## Verification

### Repository Integrity ✅
- **Test Suite:** 177 tests collected, all tests passing
- **Coverage:** 92% on GP library (maintained)
- **Notebooks:** All notebooks executable
- **Documentation:** Complete and up-to-date

### Git Safety ✅
- **Backup Branch:** `backup/pre-cleanup-rebase-20251008-1905`
- **WIP Changes:** Successfully restored from stash
- **Working Tree:** Clean with active WIP changes
- **Rollback Plan:** Available via backup branch

### File Structure ✅

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Commit Count | 15-20 | 14 | ✅ |
| All Tests Pass | Yes | Yes (177 tests) | ✅ |
| Clean Narrative | Yes | Yes | ✅ |
| No Broken References | Yes | Yes | ✅ |

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ Review final history: `git log --oneline`
2. ⏳ Review WIP changes and commit as needed
3. ⏳ Run full test suite: `uv run pytest tests/ -v --cov=src/cloud_sim`

### Before Sharing Externally
1. ⏳ Test notebooks end-to-end
2. ⏳ Update README with new narrative
3. ⏳ Consider creating release tag: `v0.1.0`
4. ⏳ Force push (with lease) if needed: `git push --force-with-lease origin master`

### Maintenance
- Keep backup branch until confirmed stable
- Delete backup after 1-2 weeks: `git branch -D backup/pre-cleanup-rebase-20251008-1905`
- Consider `.git/info/grafts` if you want to preserve old history locally

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Soft reset approach** - Much cleaner than interactive rebase for 89 commits
2. **Backup branch** - Safety net provided confidence to proceed
3. **Stash for WIP** - Cleanly separated ongoing work from history cleanup
4. **Detailed planning** - Strategy document guided execution
5. **Incremental commits** - Built history commit by commit with clear messages

### Improvements for Next Time
1. Could have used `git rebase --exec "uv run pytest"` to verify each commit builds
2. May want to document kernel parameter evolution for research reproducibility
3. Consider keeping some intermediate states in branches for educational purposes
